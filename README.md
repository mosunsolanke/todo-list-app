# To-Do List Web App

## Description
This is a simple, user-friendly To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, and delete tasks.  
Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so the list persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- Add tasks using an input field and button or pressing Enter.  
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them (tasks get crossed out).  
- Delete tasks using the Delete button next to each task.  
- Tasks are saved locally in the browser and persist across sessions.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Browser Local Storage API

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.  
2. Type a task in the input box and click “Add Task” or press Enter.  
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed.  
4. Click the “Delete” button to remove a task.

## Future Improvements
- Add the ability to edit existing tasks.  
- Add due dates and sort tasks by date.  
- Make the app responsive for mobile devices.  
- Integrate with a backend to sync tasks across devices.
